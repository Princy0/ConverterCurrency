# Currency Converter using Tkinter in Python

This is a simple currency converter program written in Python using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. This program allows the user to convert between different currencies, using up-to-date exchange rates fetched from a public API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required packages using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```
   python currency_converter.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you run the program, you will be presented with a simple GUI that allows you to select the currencies you want to convert between and enter the amount you want to convert. The program will then fetch the exchange rate from the API and display the converted amount.

### Notes

- The exchange rates are fetched from the [Open Exchange Rates](https://api.exchangerate.host/latest) API, which requires an API key. By default, this program uses a demo API key, which has limited usage. To obtain a full API key, you can sign up for a free account on the Open Exchange Rates website.
- This program uses the Tkinter GUI toolkit, which is included with Python by default. No additional installation is required.
- This program was developed and tested on Windows 10, using Python 3.9.2 and Tkinter 8.6.
